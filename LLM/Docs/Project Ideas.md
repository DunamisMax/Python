   - Use `pytest` or `unittest` with well-structured tests.
   - Employ CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) for automated tests, linting (black, flake8), coverage, and deployment.

3. **Version Control Best Practices:**
   - Meaningful commit messages.
   - Use branches and pull requests for new features.
   - Tag or release versions with changelogs.

4. **Showcase Architecture & Design Patterns:**
   - Even a small project can demonstrate the use of design patterns like Factory, Strategy, or MVC.

5. **Include a License & Contributing Guide:**
   - Encourage others to contribute.
   - Use a common license (MIT, Apache, etc.) that matches your goals.

6. **Deployment & Hosting:**
   - Provide instructions for running locally vs. in Docker.
