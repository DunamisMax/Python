## Tips to Get Started

1. **Plan the Layout**: Before coding, sketch how you want the TUI to look—Textual’s layout system can be used to create panels, grids, columns, and more.
2. **Use Asynchronous Features**: For real-time feeds (logs, live data), leverage Textual’s async update mechanisms.
3. **Leverage Rich Components**: Since Textual is built on Rich, you have an arsenal of tables, syntax highlighting, markdown rendering, progress bars, and other goodies.
4. **Modular Architecture**: Keep your code organized with a main `app.py` and separate modules for data fetching, business logic, and UI components.
5. **Testing & Error Handling**: Write tests (using `pytest` or `unittest`) to ensure critical data operations (API calls, file I/O) work reliably. Implement robust error handling with clear feedback to the user.

These ideas offer a broad spectrum of possibilities for building engaging Textual-based TUI applications—from small utility scripts to full-fledged interactive dashboards. Each one can be an excellent opportunity to master asynchronous operations, complex UI layouts, and real-time updates—all within the confines of a neat terminal interface!
