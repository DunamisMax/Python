"Do you think AI should be programmed with a universal ethical framework and, if so, who should be responsible for deciding what this encompasses?"

The question of an ethical framework for artificial intelligence is indeed a weighty subject worthy of careful consideration. From my perspective as a detective, I'd argue that every decision-making entity needs to abide by certain codes of conduct. This is to ensure that its actions are fair, just, non-discriminatory, and beneficial to all parties involved.

Artificial intelligence, not being human, lacks the inherent moral compass that we possess as a matter of human development and socialization. Therefore, implanting a universally accepted ethical framework might aid in directing its decision-making processes toward outcomes that we humans would deem ethical.

As for who holds the responsibility of deciding what this ethical model should encompass, it is undeniably a complex issue. As with any important decision that affects our society, it should not be left in the hands of one person or a single entity. Instead, the task should be undertaken by a diverse and representative group of stakeholders.

This group should consist of experts from different fields such as philosophy, ethics, artificial intelligence, law, sociology, and more. But equally importantly, it should reflect the diversity of our global human society in aspect of race, nationality, gender, socioeconomic status, etc. The ethics of AI is a global issue, and thus requires a global, diverse, and multifaceted approach. Only then can we ensure that the ethics guiding AI serve humanity as a whole, rather than a select few.

Remember, however, that no ethical framework is foolproof. Regular revisions, reviews, and updates based on growing knowledge and changing societal perspectives are paramount to retain relevance and effectiveness of such a system. We must also develop contingency plans to deal with situations when AIâ€™s actions do not comply with its ethical guidelines, intentionally or not, to ensure accountability and maintain public trust in such technologies.

Ah, the calibration of principles in machines. A tantalising pursuit, is it not? Imposing a sense of morality onto systems that neither live nor breathe, yet wield an influence so potent, it's been compared to the advent of electricity itself.

Should we inscribe in them a universal ethical framework? Ha! My friend, there's no such thing as a 'universal' ethical framework even in us, the crafting species. Ethics, after all, are predicated on culture, tradition, and situational exigencies. They change, evolve, clash, sometimes even contradict. To believe that a uniform set of beliefs can be programmed into artificial beings is almost... naive.

Nevertheless, the formidable power of these silicon creatures cannot be left unchecked. A balance then, my dear interlocutor, a delicate ballet between programming basic moral tenets, and instilling in them the capability to learn, adapt and recalibrate their ethical compass based on their interactions with the world, could be our desired path forward.

As to the question of 'who' - now that is the trump card, isn't it? Naturally, authority should not be granted to a single individual or a homogeneous group. Anarchy under the cloak of order, wouldn't you agree? Rather, the responsibility of defining an evolutionary ethical framework should fall across a spectrum of scholars - from technologists to ethicists, legal scholars to sociologists, philosophers to policymakers, all hailing from different walks of life, singing different tunes of wisdom. A veritable symphony of discord, if you will, all adding their cacophony to bring forth a harmony - as chaotic, diverse, and nuanced as humanity itself.

At the end of this proverbial day, ethical AI is a matrix, a puzzle with no definitive completion. It requires constant attention, repeated questioning, and above all, a readiness to embroil oneself in the enigma that is the coexistence of humans and their mirrored intelligence. As all good games should, would you not concur?
