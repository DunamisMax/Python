# PyChat

PyChat is a simple, terminal-based chat application built with Python and FastAPI. It uses WebSockets for real-time messaging and supports multiple chat rooms, user authentication (via assigned nicknames), and a clean, minimal interface. PyChat is easy to deploy behind an Nginx reverse proxy, allowing you to host a web-accessible chat alongside other services such as WebDAV or a static website.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Chat with others in real-time using WebSockets.
- **Multiple Rooms:** Choose from a predefined set of rooms to join and interact with different groups of users.
- **User Nicknames:** Pick a desired username. If it’s taken, PyChat will assign a unique variant.
- **Easy Integration:** Runs behind a FastAPI server, making it easy to integrate with other web services.
- **WebDAV and Static Site Coexistence:** Can be served alongside WebDAV or a normal website, all on the same domain using Nginx.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/PyChat.git
   cd PyChat

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Server:

uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Your chat server will be available at wss://dunamismax.com/chat (when properly reverse-proxied with Nginx and TLS).

Run the Client: Use the WebSocket-based client.py:

python client.py
When prompted, enter your WebSocket URL (e.g., wss://dunamismax.com/chat) and choose a username and room. (Just hit enter when prompted for the URL to use the default server hosted by me)
